<h2>Train to Aim</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Aim and Shoot the target in front of you
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the player to read the story and play the game like their life is determined by this one exam. 
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
3rd person shooter
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The game play is pretty simple, point and click to shoot the gun onto the target, R to reload the gun, and E to get a new target.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Usually when you hear about police with a grudge, you see the entire chase between the cop and the bad guy. But what if that police never got
 accepted into the academy? My goal to take this idea of a police with a grudge and change it into a man vs the police.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The feature for this game are to shoot, reload, and get a new target. I wanted to add in more like moving the target, some animation, sounds,
 and different points but trying to figure out how to transcribe the bullet holes to move with the target took too much of my time.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The setting in inside a police shooting range
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
When you were 14 both of your parents were shot dead in a brutal murder. You have pledged your life to hunt this murderer down and serve
 them the justice they deserve. But first you have to pass the police entrance test. The only thing between you and your goal is to pass 
 the shooting exam. Time to practice and ace this exam.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience would be 10+, so they can understand and feel the story.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
It takes around 1 mintute to play, but you can keep playing as long as you like.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Squint your eyes, look really close at where you are aiming.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I created all of my own assets.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I didn't look to see what games my prototype resembles but I'm pretty sure there is one out there.
